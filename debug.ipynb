       "['It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.\\nMore of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.\\nThrough this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility.\\nOur relations abroad were strained.\\nYou can tell that I\\'m a lame duck because nobody\\'s following instructions.\\nAnd today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we\\'re wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.\\nOver the course of these 8 years, I\\'ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers.\\nBut most of all, congratulations to the Class of 2016!\\nThe pace of change is not subsiding; it is accelerating.\\nAmerica, we cannot turn back.\\nBut for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire.\\nWhen trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service.\\nThe uninsured rate has never, ever been lower.\\nYou also survived the daily jockeying for buses, from Livingston to Busch, to Cook, to Douglass, and back again.\\nWe can invest in early childhood education.\\nWe see no—we seek no military bases there.\\nFor native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish and Italians and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America.\\nThat\\'s how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty.\\nBecause I know our work has not only helped so many Americans, it has inspired so many Americans, especially so many young people out there, to believe that you can make a difference, to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves.\\nOur life expectancy has, as well.\\nYou’ll meet them if you haven\\'t already.\\nOnly if our politics better reflects the decency of our people.\\nYou are smart, and you are beautiful, but more importantly, you are kind, and you are thoughtful, and you are full of passion.\\nIt is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.\\nThe fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great—a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.\\nOn education, we will expand exchange programs and increase scholarships like the one that brought my father to America.\\nA while back, you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as “proof” that the world was not warming.\\nNot in my ability to bring about change, but in yours.\\nAmericans are ready to join with citizens and governments, community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.\\nWe can\\'t disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism.\\nAnd we’re funding a Post-9/11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education.\\nNow, we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem.\\nIf something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing.\\nThat’s a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today.\\nAnd that\\'s why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started.\\nIt wasn’t because the facts and the evidence showed they wouldn\\'t work.\\nI\\'ve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch.\\nIf you disagree with somebody, bring them in -- (applause) -- and ask them tough questions.\\nThe second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians, and the Arab world.\\nFor 240 years, our Nation\\'s call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation.\\nThis was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office.\\nNot with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.\\nAnd more importantly, our democracy wins.\\nBuilding walls won’t change that.\\nWe’ve closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases.\\nIn his own Farewell Address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but \"from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken .\\nI\\'ve got to—I\\'ve got to move.\\nAnd we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they’re talking about.\\nWell it\\'s time for them to own their failure.\\nAnd more often than not, your faith in America, and in Americans, will be confirmed.\\nAmerica, our work will not be easy.\\nWe’ve doubled the production of clean energy.\\nIt determines who our Congress is.\\nIndividual responsibility and mutual responsibility—that\\'s the essence of America\\'s promise.\\nLet me also address the issue of Iraq.\\nOver 7 years ago, the United States pursued Al Qaida and the Taliban with broad international support.\\nFor peace to come, it is time for them, and all of us, to live up to our responsibilities.\\nWords alone cannot meet the needs of our people.\\nPart of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor.\\nWe measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.\\nIf John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice—but it is not the change we need.\\nWhen violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean.\\nAll of us share this world for but a brief moment in time.\\nBut we must also admit that programs alone can\\'t replace parents; that government can\\'t turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.\\nNone of these changes happened overnight.\\nAnd we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health.\\nNow, I don\\'t believe that Senator McCain doesn\\'t care what\\'s going on in the lives of Americans.\\nMany more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.\\nFor too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform.\\nAnd this cycle of suspicion and discord must end.\\nThat\\'s how we banned child labor.\\nEven as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began.\\nIn that time, he\\'s said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.\\nAnd so we have to preserve this truth with \"jealous anxiety;\" that we should reject \"the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties\" that make us one.\\nSo America will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law, and we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities, which are also threatened.\\nThe reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don\\'t tell me we can\\'t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.\\nAnd it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous.\\nIndeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists.\\nAnd we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.\\nI understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not.\\nAnd all of us have more work to do.\\nNot just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother.\\nWe can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement.\\nThey work hard and give back and keep going without complaint.\\nAmong some Muslims, there\\'s a disturbing tendency to measure one\\'s own faith by the rejection of somebody else\\'s faith.\\nWithout these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.\\nIsolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country -- (applause) -- that is not just a betrayal of our values -- (applause) -- that\\'s not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism.\\nThere\\'s so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.\\nWashington\\'s been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.\\nInstead, they overlap and share common principles, principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.\\nYou have shown what history teaches us—that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn\\'t come from Washington.\\nTheir actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam.\\nI have mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in a Charleston church.\\nBecause of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past 8 years.\\nWe have to pay attention and listen.\\nPeople in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.\\nWe’ve cut extreme poverty drastically.\\nAnd you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily.\\nBut somehow, you have survived such death-defying acts.\\nIslamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires, timeless poetry and cherished music, elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.\\nThat\\'s why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdallah\\'s interfaith dialog and Turkey\\'s leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations.\\nBut if the past two decades have taught us anything, it’s that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation.\\nThey have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.\\nWe were born out of revolution against an empire.\\nIt\\'s why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima, Iraq and Afghanistan, and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.\\nU.S. troops pulled out of Iraq’s cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.\\nThis same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia, from Eastern Europe to Indonesia.\\nThey didn’t happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything.\\nIndeed, it suggests the opposite.\\nSo don’t lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock.\\nTrade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change in communities.\\nBut it was not violence that won full and equal rights.\\nAnd a wall won\\'t stop that.\\nAnd finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles.\\nI know—[applause]—I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue.\\nBut if you were listening to today’s political debate, you might wonder where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from.\\nFor part of what has been lost these past eight years can\\'t just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.\\nWhy else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?\\nWhen voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.\\nIt\\'s easier to start wars than to end them.\\nWe have everything we need to meet those challenges.\\nOn economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim-majority countries.\\nIt sounds like mine, anyway.\\nThis is the hope of all humanity.\\nThey shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people, trained Iraqi Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.\\nOur common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity, men and women, to reach their full potential.\\nAnd I\\'ll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy—wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can\\'t ever be outsourced.\\nThe rejection of facts, the rejection of reason and science -- that is the path to decline.\\nAnd next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.\\nI\\'m emphasizing such investment within my own country.\\nIf you don\\'t, you\\'ll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.\\nIf the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.\\nAnd when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, kept in his personal library.\\nRivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world, unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.\\nAnd we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude.\\nIn the past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker.\\nViolent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small, but potent minority of Muslims.\\nI am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the Moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can.\\nBut, ironically, the flood of information hasn’t made us more discerning of the truth.\\nWe will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security, because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women, and children.\\nYet no one can doubt President Bush’s support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.\\nAnd in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.\\nTerrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart.\\nWe’re treating the signature wounds of today’s wars -- post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.\\nto weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth.\"\\nBut for now, whether you are young or whether you\\'re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President, the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me 8 years ago.\\nYou make a big election about small things.\\nThe obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.\\nSo if we\\'re going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination: in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system.\\nIt\\'s easier to blame others than to look inward.\\nTomorrow I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the Third Reich.\\nSo let\\'s be vigilant, but not afraid.\\nThe market will fix it.\\nWe’ve removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.\\nAnd when one of his chief advisors—the man who wrote his economic plan—was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we\\'ve become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"\\nIt was Islam, at places like Al-Azhar, that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe\\'s renaissance and enlightenment.\\nBut I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less—because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.\\nAnd when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:  The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States.\\nMake them defend their positions.\\nOur Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift, but it\\'s really just a piece of parchment.\\nThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity.\\nThis country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.\\nWe must use all elements of our power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of America’s example -- to secure our interests and stand by our allies.\\nNow, for some of you, this may sound like your college career.\\nBecause I\\'ve lived it.\\nThere was hail when I landed in Newark.\\nOne of the perks of my job is honorary degrees.\\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.\\nAnd I will not settle for an America where some kids don\\'t have that chance.\\nAnd all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for Iraqis’ future.\\nSet aside life in the ‘50s, when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life.\\nThe relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars.\\nFor centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.\\nWe have what we need to do so.\\nYou understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.\\nLook, I know it’s not always pretty.\\nTwenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance.\\nLast year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.\\nThese are the Americans that I know.\\nBut I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world.\\nToday, you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined.\\nThousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.\\nAnd finally, the Arab States must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.\\nWe’re less dependent on foreign oil.\\nIslam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism, it is an important part of promoting peace.\\nDon\\'t lose hope in the face of naysayers.\\nBut you are the first to launch a three-year campaign.\\nTell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.\\nFor while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.\\nIraq\\'s sovereignty is its own.\\nI do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles.\\nBut what the people heard instead—people of every creed and color, from every walk of life—is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.\\nIn the Republicans who never thought they\\'d pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.\\nWhen Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.\\nI\\'ve seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again.\\nAnd these changes offer not only great opportunity, but also great peril.\\nSo that faith that I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change—that faith has been rewarded in ways I could not have possibly imagined.\\nWe meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate.\\nIt was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America\\'s founding.\\nIf you don\\'t have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\\nAmerica respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them.\\nBut that potential will only be realized if our democracy works.\\nHealth care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.\\nIt has no power on its own.\\nA shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change, and the specter of terrorism—these forces haven\\'t just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well.\\nOur government should work for us, not against us.\\nThe top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the U.S.\\nAnd today, in every phone in one of your pockets -- (laughter) -- we have access to more information than at any time in human history, at a touch of a button.\\nBut there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend.\\nCountries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures.\\nNot just when there\\'s an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime.\\nBecause if you don\\'t have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.\\nAnd yet, we\\'ve become confused about this.\\nWe\\'re on live TV here.\\nAnd, yes, big money in politics is a huge problem.\\nSo that\\'s what we mean when we say America\\'s exceptional: not that our Nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who follow.\\nToday, America has a dual responsibility to help Iraq forge a better future and to leave Iraq to Iraqis.\\nBut to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country, the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.\\nThey have killed in many countries.\\nThe times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.\\nIt’s that simple.\\nYou see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.\\nBlacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics.\\nProgress doesn’t travel in a straight line.\\nI know a couple years ago, folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement.\\nIt\\'s what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom.\\nTake it with a grain of salt.\\nIn Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is—you\\'re on your own.\\nIt\\'s a story with a simple truth: Violence is a dead end.\\nHe’d get a D.\\nThe share of Americans with college educations have gone way up.\\nNow, I say all these things not to make you complacent.\\nLook at what Matthew is doing.\\nAnd I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.\\nChange happens because the American people demand it—because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.\\nWe measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job—an economy that honors the dignity of work.\\nBut make no mistake:  This transition will begin -- because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people’s.\\nWe did not have spell-check back in my day.\\nIn 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since World War II.\\nThat\\'s it, Class of 2016 -- (laughter) -- a few suggestions on how you can change the world.\\nYou made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.\\nOf all that I\\'ve done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.\\nHold their feet to the fire.\\nAnd to accomplish those things, to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads.\\nThey have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach.\\nBut, as was the case in Iraq, we can’t do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.\\nAs a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.\\nWhen I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.\\nI know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.\\nWe weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others, when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.\\nAnd certainly don’t let resistance make you cynical.\\nThe attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights.\\nIn other words, it will determine our future.\\nAs a student of history, I also know civilization\\'s debt to Islam.\\nIf John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that\\'s a debate I\\'m ready to have.\\nAnd a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed -- that\\'s one of the changes that\\'s been taking place -- jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage.\\n(Laughter and applause.)\\nFor Blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face, not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged White guy who, from the outside, may seem like he\\'s got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change.\\nProgress in America has been hard and contentious, and sometimes bloody.\\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I am incredibly proud of their service.\\nFor over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning, and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt\\'s advancement.\\nAnd like all Americans, I’m awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families.\\nOnce in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others.\\n“Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world,” he said.\\nJohn McCain likes to say that he\\'ll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell—but he won\\'t even go to the cave where he lives.\\nIt\\'s not because I wasn’t proposing them.\\nWe seized the future and made it our own.\\nIt won\\'t boost our economy, and it won’t enhance our security either.\\nFinally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.\\nIt falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we\\'ve been given to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours.\\nAs the Holy Koran tells us: \"Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.\"\\nBecause that, after all, is why we serve.\\nThe President: I can\\'t do that.\\nThat’s what we’ve done.\\nThe fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.\\nBut all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remains underinvestment in these areas.\\nThere were moments when, immediately after World War II, for example, or the end of the Cold War, when the world bent more easily to our will.\\nWe are a better country than this.\\nNow, that effort must begin within our own borders.\\nWe see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition.\\nOur combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq’s future is not.\\nIt\\'s the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect Union.\\nWe would gladly bring every single one of our troops home, if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can.\\nLast February, I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq’s Security Forces and support its government and people.\\nOur universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that\\'s not what keeps the world coming to our shores.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that\\'s nice.\\nBecause you did change the world.\\nSo don\\'t tell me that Democrats won\\'t defend this country.\\nThat\\'s what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy.\\nThe President: No, no, no, no, no, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next.\\nIt is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.\\nAlthough I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.\\nIn all nations, including America, this change can bring fear.\\nJust as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone of our middle class, so today’s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy.\\nYou’ll look at things with fresher eyes, unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me.\\nAmerica\\'s strong bonds with Israel are well known.\\nIt\\'s the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\nAnd engagement does not just mean deploying our military.\\nThat\\'s not challenging political correctness.\\nNow, it’s time to turn the page.\\nNow, I don\\'t think it\\'s a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration.\\nThis completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security.\\nThat spirit informed our inventors and our explorers, the Edisons and the Wright Brothers, and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers, and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses.\\nThat\\'s why we cannot withdraw from big global fights: to expand democracy and human rights and women\\'s rights and LGBT rights.\\nWe can raise the minimum wage.\\nThis history is well known.\\nAnd in so many ways, the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America -- the course by which we became bigger, stronger, and richer and more dynamic, and a more inclusive nation.\\nThat’s how democracy works.\\nThis last point is important, because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they\\'re out of power.\\nOurs is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves—protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.\\nWe may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.\\nAnd if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views, you will get what you want.\\nSo I\\'m here, off Exit 9, on the banks of the Old Raritan -- (applause) -- at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges.\\nIt was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\\nIndeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: \"I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will be.\"\\nPoint number one:  When you hear someone longing for the “good old days,” take it with a grain of salt.\\nI\\'ve seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.\\nThat is why there is a mosque in every State in our Union and over 1,200 mosques within our borders.\\nBut the next wave of economic dislocations won\\'t come from overseas.\\nWhen John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.\\nOnly Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders.\\nThat’s why we’re training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan’s problems.\\nWe all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.\\nI\\'ve come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.\\nAnd that is why we will support them everywhere.\\nBut if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.\\nWhen Washington doesn\\'t work, all its promises seem empty.\\nI am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.\\nIf you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.\\nToo much blood has been shed.\\nOur troops are the steel in our ship of state.\\nAround the world, we can turn dialog into interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to action, whether it is combating malaria in Africa or providing relief after a natural disaster.\\nAnd Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society.\\nLet me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights, Dr. Burnell and Bill Moyers.\\nNow, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I\\'ve laid out how I\\'ll pay for every dime—by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don\\'t help America grow.\\nIt’s well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset.\\nIn politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.\\nThe first nation to recognize my country was Morocco.\\nAnd if we did these things, then we’d help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody.\\nYou\\'ll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands.\\nThe people of the world can live together in peace.\\nThis new approach reflects our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.\\nOur unity at home was tested.\\nIn the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.\\nRather than remain trapped in the past, I\\'ve made it clear to Iran\\'s leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.\\nUnfortunately, over the last decade, we’ve not done what’s necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity.\\nThey have killed people of different faiths, but more than any other, they have killed Muslims.\\nSo you’ve got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification, but you got to be a citizen full-time, all the time.\\nAnd isn\\'t that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting?\\nMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you.\\nBut that is not yet the case.\\nWe can see it happening right now.\\nAs a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey, a guy named Bruce Springsteen, once sang -- (applause) -- “they spend their lives waiting for a moment that just don’t come.”  Don’t let that be you.\\nAnd a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\\nLook at somebody like Madison Little, who grew up dealing with some health issues, and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else, and so, here at Rutgers, he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic.\\nAnd the reason America is better is because we didn’t look backwards we didn’t fear the future.\\nThis truth transcends nations and peoples, a belief that isn\\'t new, that isn\\'t black or white or brown, that isn\\'t Christian or Muslim or Jew.\\nHow can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we\\'re cutting taxes for corporations?\\nAnd just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America\\'s promise abroad.\\nThat\\'s why we plan to invest $1.5 billion each year over the next 5 years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who\\'ve been displaced.\\nAnd the good news is that today the economy is growing again.\\nBut when our leaders express a disdain for facts, when they’re not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we’ve got a problem.\\nNow is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.\\nThere’s more democracy.\\nYou’re more environmentally conscious.\\n(The wind starts blowing hard.)\\nBut that\\'s what we did.\\nThis, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.\\nThe Talmud tells us: \"The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.\"\\nI just think he doesn\\'t know.\\nWe can make college more affordable.\\nBut I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military, and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing.\\nAnd that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls and to help young women pursue employment through microfinancing that helps people live their dreams.\\nThere’s not much I’m afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate.\\nThere\\'s a second threat to our democracy, and this one is as old as our Nation itself.\\nI know it\\'s getting cold and you guys have to graduate.\\nIn this global economy, that’s not even possible.\\nIt remains uneven and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like we take one step back.\\nFor over two decades, he\\'s subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy—give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.\\nIt\\'s because John McCain doesn\\'t get it.\\nPassions fly on immigration, but I don\\'t know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.\\nI\\'ll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.\\nTonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land—enough!\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Because of you!\\nThat\\'s how we became America.\\nBuilding walls won\\'t do that.\\nAs with the surge in Iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future.\\nYou know who you are.\\nNow is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.\\nThere need not be contradictions between development and tradition.\\nuntil you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\"\\nIt\\'s not because John McCain doesn\\'t care.\\nMake sure the next 250 years are better than the last.\\nThat\\'s just not knowing what you\\'re talking about.\\nYet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating.\\nUnlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.\\nAmericans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.\\nThe Internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home.\\nEnding this war is not only in Iraq’s interest -- it’s in our own.\\nIt ain’t so.\\nHow do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing?\\nAudience members: Four more years!\\nYou are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward.\\nYes, special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power.\\nAnd it\\'s not just my belief.\\nMichelle—Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side, for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend.\\nA few years later, a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class.\\nAnd this is important, because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work.\\nEach stage along the way required compromise.\\nBut for all the real progress that we\\'ve made, we know it\\'s not enough.\\nBut we\\'re not where we need to be.\\nISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.\\nHere in New Brunswick, you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class, and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first-generation Latina student from Jersey City, before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who’s going to school on the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\\nWhen they wage peaceful protest, they\\'re not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.\\nAnd I hope your faith has, too.\\nWhich brings me to my final point: Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted.\\nIt\\'s time for us to change America.\\nWe cannot impose peace.\\nI\\'ve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and, above all, to look out for each other.\\nOf course, the soldiers left much behind.\\nWe have the most powerful military on Earth, but that\\'s not what makes us strong.\\nSo, Class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be.\\nAs a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation’s long-term competitiveness is put at risk.\\nThe unemployment rate is near a 10-year low.\\nAnd that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires.\\nI mean, listen, climate change is not something subject to political spin.\\nYou look at something like trade, for example.\\nAnd from that first class in a pub, Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America.\\nPresuming a reservoir of goodness in other people, that can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you.\\nEach nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people.\\nYou’re more diverse.\\nThese are the policies I will pursue.\\nWe can modernize our infrastructure.\\nThey defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.\\nBut remember, none of this happens on its own.\\nDenying that fact is baseless, it is ignorant, and it is hateful.\\nMichelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.\\nWe did not go by choice; we went because of necessity.\\nIt actually happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing, and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion.\\nYou believe in a fair and just and inclusive America.\\nAnd that\\'s what we have to restore.\\nThat is what I will try to do today, to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.\\nWhen a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk.\\nThe question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort, a sustained effort to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings.\\nWages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again.\\nThey understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.\\nAnd maybe you’ll learn something and realize you don\\'t know everything.\\nHe said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President.\\nAnd increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it\\'s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\\nI am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions.\\nThey stared into the darkest of human creations -- war -- and helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace.\\nResistance through violence and killing is wrong, and it does not succeed.\\nIn fact, faith should bring us together.\\nLook, as President, my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States.\\nWe’ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.\\nAnd you know what—it\\'s worked before.\\nAnd how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland.\\nBut those are sporadic, those moments, those episodes.\\nNo single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons.\\nAnd I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations to live in peace and security, to get an education and to work with dignity, to love our families, our communities, and our God.\\nBut protecting our way of life, that\\'s not just the job of our military.\\nIn fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders -- and hundreds of al Qaeda’s extremist allies -- have been killed or captured around the world.\\nOf course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.\\nIt\\'s easy to point fingers, for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel\\'s founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders, as well as beyond.\\nBecause part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it.\\nI know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.\\nAnd although Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever.\\nI will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.\\nNine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country.\\nBut without bolder action, our children won\\'t have time to debate the existence of climate change.\\nNow let there be no doubt.\\nTo the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia—I love you so much, and I\\'m so proud of all of you.\\nThe United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.\\nAnd that is, gear yourself for the long haul.\\nMore of you have cars you can\\'t afford to drive, credit card bills you can\\'t afford to pay, and tuition that\\'s beyond your reach.\\nToday, it’s 300 times more.\\nMake no mistake, we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan.\\nGo at them if they’re not making any sense.\\nWe\\'ve got to reduce its influence.\\nBut we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.\\nAnd it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln\\'s Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.\\nTo President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.\\nAnd the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class.\\nThat\\'s the promise of America—the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother\\'s keeper; I am my sister\\'s keeper.\\nBut that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America.\\nBut the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some.\\nTonight, I’d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home.\\nYou know that constant change has been America\\'s hallmark; that it\\'s not something to fear but something to embrace.\\nSenator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?\\nLikewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit, for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear.\\nBut we have also understood that our nation’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.\\nNow, there is no straight line to realize this promise, but this much is clear: Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure.\\nBecause in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.\\nSince I graduated, crime rates, teenage pregnancy, the share of Americans living in poverty -- they’re all down.\\nThe work of democracy has always been hard.\\nEven when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you.\\nBut I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history.\\nBut the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.\\nFor many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.\\nThe victims were innocent men, women, and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody.\\nAnd sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that we’re trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach.\\nConsistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.\\nSome are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress.\\nYou can\\'t truly stand up for Georgia when you\\'ve strained our oldest alliances.\\nLet me tell you, you\\'re not the only ones.\\nBut if our democracy is to work, the way it should, in this increasingly diverse Nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said, \"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view .\\nAnd Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in Iraqi-led operations.\\nNow, I\\'ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.\\n“My peers give me a lot of hope that we’ll overcome the obstacles we face in society.”  That\\'s you!\\nI know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq.\\nHamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities.\\nYou’re not only better educated, you’ve been more exposed to the world, more exposed to other cultures.\\nThis is a place where you 3D-print prosthetic hands for children, and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean, renewable energy.\\nWhether we have seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms and in schools, at farms, on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going.\\nYou won’t always get everything you want -- at least not as fast as you want it.\\nIt may not be perfect, it may not be great, but it\\'s good.\\nHow else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?\\nBut, contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right, the system isn’t as rigged as you think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think.\\nThat is the world we seek, but we can only achieve it together.\\nMeanwhile, the struggle for women\\'s equality continues in many aspects of American life and in countries around the world.\\nUnlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.\\nOn the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people, Muslims and Christians, have suffered in pursuit of a homeland.\\nSocial attitudes oftentimes take generations to change.\\nAnd if you opt out, or stop paying attention, you won’t.\\nA new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow.\\nThat\\'s why the United States Government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny it.\\nThe wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records.\\nThey have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civil rights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they\\'ve excelled in our sports arenas; they\\'ve won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch.\\nNow Malia and Sasha just say, “Okay, Dr. Dad, we’ll see you later.\\nWe assume whatever is on the web must be true.\\nYou’ll figure it out.\\nSo it’s up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate.\\nWhen overseas states start falling apart, they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores.\\nSo let there be no doubt, the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable, and America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.\\nFor if we don\\'t create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.\\nAmerica is no fragile thing, but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.\\nBut what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.\\nThey could\\'ve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.\\n[Laughter] Everybody have a seat.\\nBut I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.\\nTonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.\\nBecause I\\'ve seen it.\\nThey sought to escape superstition, and sectarianism, and tribalism, and no-nothingness.\\nYou and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007.\\nFour years ago, I stood before you and told you my story—of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren\\'t well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Can\\'t do it.\\nAnd in exchange, I\\'ll ask for higher standards and more accountability.\\nIt determines what policies they prioritize.\\nAnd that\\'s why I strongly reaffirmed America\\'s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.\\nToo many tears have been shed.\\nNow, partly, I’m confident because, on average, you’re smarter and better educated than my generation -- although we probably had better penmanship -- (laughter) -- and were certainly better spellers.\\nThe wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel.\\nSo long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.\\nAnd now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day\\'s work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.\\nBut politics is a battle of ideas.\\nThis moment—this election—is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.\\nEverybody, please have a seat.\\nThroughout our history, a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom, and more opportunity, and more justice.\\nThat is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq\\'s democratically elected Government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012.\\nAt the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel\\'s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine\\'s.\\nAnd this trend represents a third threat to our democracy.\\nTogether with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future.\\nThis construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.\\nThat is the spirit we need today.\\nBut privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away.\\nIt was just a convoy of brave Americans, making their way home.\\nThey\\'ll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.\\nSome suggest that it isn\\'t worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash.\\nThe men and women who gathered there could\\'ve heard many things.\\nToday, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.\\nAnd we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq.\\nI\\'ll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.\\nIt\\'s easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share.\\nUnderstand, democracy does not require uniformity.\\nA war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.\\nAnd I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country: You, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world.\\nBecause one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other\\'s character and patriotism.\\nSuggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants -- that doesn’t just run counter to our history as the world’s melting pot; it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe.\\nThe Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.\\nIslam has a proud tradition of tolerance.\\nWe are taking concrete actions to change course.\\nLook, our nation’s Founders -- Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson -- they were born of the Enlightenment.\\nWe are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before.\\nWe will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy, but we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and never as a patron.\\nThe Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern with institutions that serve the needs of its people.\\nIt didn’t happen because some massive political revolution occurred.\\nFor too many of us, it\\'s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions.\\nBut the answer isn’t to stop trading with other countries.\\nPoliticians care about being elected, and they especially care about being reelected.\\nAnd next week, we\\'ll also hear about those occasions when he\\'s broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.\\nBut laws alone won\\'t be enough.\\nIt\\'s not cool to not know what you\\'re talking about.\\nAnd as it turned out, America wasn\\'t weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this Nation\\'s creed, and this Nation was strengthened.\\nAnd when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.\\nBecause of our troops and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people -- Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain.\\nSince the start of this new millennium, you’ve already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks, and war, and a Great Recession.\\nWe can argue about how to best achieve these goals.\\nWell, guess what -- none of the great strides in our history happened right away.\\nNot with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.\\nThe dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores, and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today, who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average.\\nAnd the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste—all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable.\\nWe\\'ll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops.\\nAnd to all who serve or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander in Chief.\\nIt\\'s what powered workers to organize.\\nWe cannot walk alone.\\nThe President: Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it.\\nWe have to agree that facts and evidence matter.\\nIn 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy.\\nNot with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.\\nThe answer is to do trade the right way, by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards; and we make sure they don’t impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property.\\nAnd may God bless the United States of America, and all who serve her.\\nIt\\'s been about you.\\nMoreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one\\'s religion.\\nIt was because a huge chunk of Americans, especially young people, do not vote.\\nThat is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require.\\nWe traditionally have valued those things.\\nNew markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas.\\nSince the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.\\nWe have created you male and a female, and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.\"\\nSo regardless of the station that we occupy, we all have to try harder.\\nYou took on a role you didn\\'t ask for and you made it your own, with grace and with grit and with style and good humor.\\nWe are the party of Roosevelt.\\nThe point is, to help ourselves we’ve got to help others -- (applause) -- not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out.\\nAs one staff sergeant said, “I know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day would probably mean a lot.”       Those Americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries.\\nThe pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for Afghanistan will endure.\\nNow, if we want to reverse those trends, there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference.\\nAnd if participation means voting, and it means compromise, and organizing and advocacy, it also means listening to those who don’t agree with you.\\nNow, it’s our turn.\\nAnd I\\'ve seen it in this campaign.\\nThank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.\\nThat’s why we’ve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.\\nBut the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State, or shutting out what she had to say -- I believe that’s misguided.\\nThat\\'s how progress happens -- in societies and in our own lives.\\nThey’re earning more money -- although it’s long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men.\\nThat commitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it.\\nBut the record\\'s clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.\\nFortunately, your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future.\\nIf you doubt you can make a difference, look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making.\\nOur most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work.\\nI always tell my daughters, you know, better is good.\\nThe Holy Bible tells us: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\"\\nWe are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.\\nMay God continue to bless the United States of America.\\nThe truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives—on health care and education and the economy—Senator McCain has been anything but independent.\\nAnd ultimately, that\\'s how we help raise wages here in America.\\nThey have met every test that they faced.\\nWe all put our country first.\\nWe must face these tensions squarely.\\nI don\\'t fit the typical pedigree, and I haven\\'t spent my career in the halls of Washington.\\nWhatever path you choose -- business, nonprofits, government, education, health care, the arts -- whatever it is, you\\'re going to have some setbacks.\\nAmerica, now is not the time for small plans.\\nWe are the party of Kennedy.\\nNow, it\\'s true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year.\\nWe search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions.\\nAnd it is my first duty as President to protect the American people.\\nAnd to all of you out there—every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town, every kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change—you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for, and I will be forever grateful.\\nTo Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\\nIt even, for example, determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate.\\nExcept maybe I\\'ve got one last suggestion.\\nAll of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear, when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be, when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Muhammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer.\\nYou have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom.\\nThis afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. Bush.\\nAnd wages aren’t rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families.\\nAnd we love you and Jill like family, and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives.\\nAnd I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life.\\nAs we speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\nNow, it’s our responsibility to honor them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for -- the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it.\\nThat’s how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values -- including human rights.\\nTell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.\\nWe measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President—when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.\\nFor eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.\\nA caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election.\\nNow, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension.\\nThat\\'s what built this country.\\n\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried.\\nAnd that\\'s why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August.\\nSo whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it.\\nThe fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals.\\nLet me tell you, this generation coming up—unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic—I\\'ve seen you in every corner of the country.\\nI suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon, after a late night at Olde Queens.\\nSo no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power.\\nInstead, it is that American spirit—that American promise—that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.\\nAnd it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.\\nNow, the reason some of these things have not happened, even though the majority of people approve of them, is really simple.\\nNow, understand, I am sure you’ve learned during your years of college -- and if not, you will learn soon -- that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense.\\nWithin Afghanistan, I’ve ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of General David Petraeus -- are fighting to break the Taliban’s momentum.\\nAnd I have to say that really sealed the deal.\\nSo I\\'ve got news for you, John McCain.\\nAnd success, however small, however incomplete, success is still success.\\nI only have two more points.\\nDon’t waste your time waiting.\\nAnd he’s a senator!\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Four more years!\\nIt should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century.\\nAnd, Class of 2016, you are graduating at such an inflection point.\\nFor we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere.\\nI’m fond of quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”  (Applause.)\\nThat is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.\\nAnd that\\'s why we\\'re partnering with a coalition of 46 countries.\\nEmails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos.\\nThe sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.\\nSo let there be no doubt, Islam is a part of America.\\nThe Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans—Democrats and Republicans—have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.\\nThey represent the fear of change; the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable; an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what\\'s true and what\\'s right.\\nAs a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk.\\nBut without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we\\'re going to keep talking past each other, and we\\'ll make common ground and compromise impossible.\\nYou can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\\nGod bless this country we love.\\nAll of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging.\\nIt\\'s a faith in other people, and it\\'s what brought me here today.\\nAnd I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.\\nWe have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.\\nTo Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware\\'s favorite son, you were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best.\\nOne of the newest members of the Big Ten.\\nWe must always examine the ways in which we protect it.\\nThe sixth issue that I want to address is women\\'s rights.\\nThis tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it\\'s being challenged in many different ways.\\nMalia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women.\\nI mean, I helped, but -- (applause.)\\nIt will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle class jobs obsolete.\\nMost painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the Fourth Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice -- part of over 4,400 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq.\\nJust as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel\\'s security, neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank.\\nThere must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground.\\nAlong with nearly 1.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew.\\nNot to score points or take credit, but to make people\\'s lives better.\\nTo the Board of Governors; to Chairman Brown; to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno; Mayor Cahill; Mayor Wahler, members of Congress, Rutgers administrators, faculty, staff, friends, and family -- thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution.\\nAmerica does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.\\nI’m sure Michelle would approve.\\nThese are not just American ideas, they are human rights.\\nMoreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam.\\nIt\\'s a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.\\nQualities like kindness and compassion, honesty, hard work -- they often matter more than technical skills or know-how.\\nIt won\\'t change overnight.\\nThat\\'s the promise we need to keep.\\nI know there\\'s been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust.\\nBut America’s progress has never been smooth or steady.\\nEither way, you win.\\nThe question now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.\\nThat promise is our greatest inheritance.\\nBut I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed, confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice, government that is transparent and doesn\\'t steal from the people, the freedom to live as you choose.\\nI\\'ll give you an example on a lot of people’s minds right now -- and that’s the growing inequality in our economy.\\nBut let us be clear: Al Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on that day.\\nI realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.\\nAudience members: Four more years!\\nImagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball, what he would think.\\nBecause, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.\\nOver seven years before, American troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired.\\nPull yourself up by your own bootstraps—even if you don\\'t have boots.\\nBut I guess it\\'s part of human nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked, and the economy hummed, and all politicians were wise, and every kid was well-mannered, and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world.\\nWe live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history.\\nAnd as citizens, we all rightly put our country first.\\nThreatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.\\nSince I graduated, in 1983 -- which isn\\'t that long ago -- (laughter) -- I\\'m just saying.\\nUse your logic and reason and words.\\nDon\\'t be scared to take somebody on.\\nBut tonight, tonight it\\'s my turn to say thanks.\\nBut I also believe that the arc of our nation, the arc of the world does not bend towards justice, or freedom, or equality, or prosperity on its own.\\nIf somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong.\\nIn an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation.\\nAnd so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.\\nIn ancient times and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education.\\nThese challenges are not all of government\\'s making.\\nThis issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\nThey believed in rational thought and experimentation, and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates.\\nLook, if you want to change this country for the better, you better start participating.\\nIn some ways, it’s just made us more confident in our ignorance.\\nIt\\'s the beating heart of our American idea, our bold experiment in self-government.\\nAfter all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth.\\nThat\\'s what you did.\\nBecause it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.\\nIf your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it\\'s best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.\\nAnd we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create a new online network so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo.\\nFor instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.\\nBecause in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton\\'s Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.\\nI love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.\\nToday I\\'m announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio.\\nAnd for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\\nHow else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people\\'s benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?\\nNow is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.\\nTwo weeks ago, America’s final combat brigade in Iraq -- the Army’s Fourth Stryker Brigade -- journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness.\\nImagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that.\\nI’m confident that you can make the right choices -- away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation and innovation and hope.\\nSo I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties.\\nOnly if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\\nYou answered people\\'s hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\\nAfter my election, there was talk of a postracial America.\\nAll of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.\\nSo let me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.\\nBut because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists, progress has been this nation’s hallmark.\\nWe’ve got a bunch of big problems to solve.\\nWe know that is God\\'s vision, now that must be our work here on Earth.\\nWe meet at one of those defining moments—a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.\\nIn Ankara, I made clear that America is not, and never will be, at war with Islam.\\nI believe that\\'s misguided.\\nExtremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.\\nAnd so we\\'re going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now, and make more reforms to the Tax Code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from this new economy don\\'t avoid their obligations to the country that\\'s made their very success possible.\\nMarriage equality is the law of the land.\\nAnd I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases and no claim on their territory or resources.\\nThe greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.\\nWhy would we want to stop it now?\\nMuch has changed since that night.\\nInstead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel\\'s legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.\\nI know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans.\\nIt\\'s a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world.\\nI\\'ll invest in early childhood education.\\nIn fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.\\nAnd any nation, including Iran, should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power, if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\\nThey could\\'ve heard words of anger and discord.\\nAnd I\\'m hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.\\nI have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year.\\nWhat has also been lost is our sense of common purpose—our sense of higher purpose.\\nAt this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.\\nBecause for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women—students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors—found the courage to keep it alive.\\nAnd just as America is better, the world is better than when I graduated.\\nAnd so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together.\\nI will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.\\nAnd that\\'s why we\\'re forging service projects in America to bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\\nIf I had told you 8 years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history; if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran\\'s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11; if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens—if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.\\nThe situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America\\'s goals and our need to work together.\\nHere, too, it’s time to turn the page.\\nI\\'m a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.\\nSo, just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\\nThat\\'s the economic argument.\\nAnd I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.\\nLet me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest—a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours—Hillary Rodham Clinton.\\nIt\\'s what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande.\\nI don\\'t think that\\'s how democracy works best, when we\\'re not even willing to listen to each other.\\nSuppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.\\nThat order is now being challenged, first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam, more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets and open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power.\\nIf we get on a plane, we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane.\\nAnd every day, I have learned from you.\\nWe live in an age of global supply chains, and cargo ships that crisscross oceans, and online commerce that can render borders obsolete.\\nNow, much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President.\\nEvery day, tens of thousands of students come here, to this intellectual melting pot, where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America’s most diverse student body.\\nIf you\\'re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\\nThat\\'s why I stand here tonight.\\nThe challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.\\nOperation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.\\nYou must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party.\\nWe\\'ve cut infant mortality by an enormous amount.\\nShe poured everything she had into me.\\nAnd we have shown that our economy doesn\\'t have to be a zero-sum game.\\nIt\\'s a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours—a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.\\nYou made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\\nAnd by the way, I\\'m not -- set aside 150 years ago, pre-Civil War -- there’s a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about.\\nThey expected us to do the same.\\nGoing forward, a transitional force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission:  advising and assisting Iraq’s Security Forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.\\nBut they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity: the idea that for all our outward differences, we\\'re all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.\\nI believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.\\nAnd while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.\\nThe “good old days” weren’t that great.\\nBut it should be their choice.\\nTwo hundred and fifty years ago, when America was still just an idea, a charter from the Royal Governor -- Ben Franklin’s son -- established Queen’s College.\\nBut my personal story is not so unique.\\nWhich brings me to my third point:  Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science -- these are good things.\\nYet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.\\nIt happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process.\\nWe’ve now been through nearly a decade of war.\\nBut I have to tell you, it impresses nobody in my house.\\nMeanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high school, we’re also better off.\\nBecause for all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: citizen.\\nThe Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.\\nNow is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.\\nSo let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.\\nThat\\'s how we cleaned up our air and our water.\\nI also know that Islam has always been a part of America\\'s story.\\nBut think about the climate change issue.\\nThat\\'s a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.\\nCan we have some money?”  (Laughter.)\\nIn the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.\\nAround the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.\\nI am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well, and proposed budgets add up, and our environment is protected.\\nEvery American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg; from Iwo Jima to Inchon; from Khe Sanh to Kandahar -- Americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own.\\nYou know, it\\'s interesting that if we get sick, we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school, they know what they’re talking about.\\nSo tonight, I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.\\nThese are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.\\nIt zigs and zags in fits and starts.\\nOf course, violence will not end with our combat mission.\\nBecause next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.\\nBut if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth.\\nPoint four:  Have faith in democracy.\\nWhen innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience.\\nIraqis are a proud people.\\nIf we don’t act, if we don\\'t follow through on the progress we made in Paris, the progress we\\'ve been making here at home, your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe.\\nIt is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse: the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral, the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.\\nAnd I\\'m also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: As-salaamu alaykum.\\nSo you’ve got the tools to lead us.\\nFrom this desk, seven and a half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.\\nNot with so much work to be done.\\nThis country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that\\'s not what makes us rich.\\nI will eliminate capital gains taxes

long as I am President, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.\\nIt\\'s that spirit, a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations, but built on principles: the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion and speech and assembly, and an independent press.\\nThroughout our history, America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own

doubled our renewable energy, we\\'ve led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet.\\nFor the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.\\nWe cannot turn back.\"\\nFor decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a

at home there\\'s another threat, a cancer gnawing away at our nation\\'s health.\\nMost countries share our concern for principle.\\nI am guided by certain traditions.\\nSo, tonight let me outline four key challenges to be met.\\nThis is the first time in my Presidency that I\\'ve made an appeal like this to you, the American people.\\nI cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.\\nAfter all, the facts are on our side.\\nInstead, he remained intransigent, certain that time was on his side.\\nThe majority of them created in the past six years paid an average of more than $22,000 a year.\\nAnd although free people in a free society are bound to have their differences, Americans traditionally come together in times of adversity and challenge.\\nThis past weekend, in a last-ditch effort, the Secretary-General of the United Nations went to the Middle East with peace in his heart—his second such mission.\\nI thank the voters who supported me.\\nAs for me, I have held high office and done the work of democracy day by day.\\nThey emerged from their bunker broken, tears streaming from their eyes, fearing the worst.\\nAnd this I promise you: For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to the Kuwaitis, and to the entire world, Saddam and those around him are accountable.\\nBut only one has proved it can deliver.\\nEither way, we\\'re in an unprecedented position to change the nature of our relationship.\\nI am going to have the FBI trace the medical wastes and we are going to punish the people who dump those infected needles into our oceans, lakes and rivers.\\nAnd now I turn to the American people to share my hopes and intentions, and why - and where - I wish to lead.\\nOne issue Look at the world on this bright August night.\\nFor ours will never be a truly prosperous nation until all within it prosper.\\nLet me tell you more about the mission.\\nWe\\'re now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders.\\nWe will do it - by maintaining our commitment to free and fair trade, by keeping government spending down, and by keeping taxes down.\\nIt is that simple - and that big.\\nIn the war just ended, there were clear-cut objectives—timetables—and, above all, an overriding imperative to achieve results.\\nIran and Iraq move toward peace.\\nListen to Master Sergeant J.P. Kendall of the 82d Airborne: \"We\\'re here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas.\\nLet their return remind us that all those who have gone before are linked with us in the long line of freedom\\'s march.\\nThey are the Nation\\'s finest.\\nSome would say it\\'s soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things.\\nShould our children have the right to say a voluntary prayer, or even observe a moment of silence in the schools?\\nWe will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining chips ever.\"\\nI know the liberal democrats are worried about the economy.\\nThey\\'ve already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions.\\nEveryone who can should contribute something, and no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share.\\nAnd they did it using America\\'s state-of-the-art technology.\\nTonight, I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops.\\nOur uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose: to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature.\\nLet us honor them as individuals—men and women of every race, all creeds and colors—by setting the face of this nation against discrimination, bigotry, and hate.\\nI seek the presidency for a single purpose, a purpose that has motivated millions of Americans across the years and the ocean voyages.\\nLet it be clear: Our vital national interests depend on a stable and secure Gulf.\\nI have come to this hall to tell you, and to tell America: Tonight is the night.\\nCompetence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn\\'t for a second understand the magic of the machine.\\nThis is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first test of our mettle.\\nThere is something noble and majestic about the pride, about the patriotism that we feel tonight.\\nAt home, the material cost of our leadership can be steep.\\nInterest rates were more than 21.\\nSo, to everyone here and everyone watching at home, think about the men and women of Desert Storm.\\nOur commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait.\\nI\\'m hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualties will be held to an absolute minimum.\\nGovernment is part of the nation of communities - not the whole, just a part.\\nArab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution, only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwait.\\nA prudent skepticism is in order.\\nAny one of us alone might have written a better plan.\\nBut if we succeed, every American will have a large burden lifted.\\nNo President can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.\\nAnd we must clean the air.\\nIt is Iraq against the world.\\nFor instance:  Should public school teachers be required to lead our children in the pledge of allegiance?\\nTonight we ask you to help us move this agreement forward.\\nWhile the world waited, Saddam sought to add to the chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses, an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction—a nuclear weapon.\\nMay God bless this great nation, the United States of America.\\nHowever, Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying the United Nations, he could weaken the forces arrayed against him.\\nIt is my hope that somehow the Iraqi people can, even now, convince their dictator that he must lay down his arms, leave Kuwait, and let Iraq itself rejoin the family of peace-loving nations.\\nIndeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety.\\nThese goals are not ours alone.\\nToday that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we\\'ve known.\\nKuwait\\'s legitimate government must be restored.\\nThe Gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than we ever should be.\\nThis is an immensely important day, a day that belongs to all of you.\\nThis is an historic moment.\\nThe recent challenge could not have been clearer.\\nSaddam Hussein was the villain; Kuwait, the victim.\\nThe ADA is a dramatic renewal not only for those with disabilities but for all of us, because along with the precious privilege of being an American comes a sacred duty to ensure that every other American\\'s rights are also guaranteed.\\nJust as important, I am convinced that this agreement will help lower interest rates.\\nAnd we\\'d moved in the wrong direction.\\nLived in a little shotgun house, one room for the three of us.\\nAnd now we\\'ve proposed a national energy strategy.\\nFor example, in 1990, we enacted an historic Clean Air Act.\\nAnd he came back from Baghdad with no progress at all in getting Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.\\nAnd surely, that is now clear.\\nI had hoped that when the United States Congress, in historic debate, took its resolute action, Saddam would realize he could not prevail and would move out of Kuwait in accord with the United Nation resolutions.\\nOut of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge: a new era—freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.\\nLet us learn from them as well.\\nWe believed in getting ahead - but blind ambition wasn\\'t our way.\\nThis job has four basic parts.\\nWe continue to hope that Iraq\\'s leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them.\\nOur objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear, our goals defined and familiar: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition.\\nI\\'m the one who won\\'t raise taxes.\\nWe got it down to four.\\nI am proud of my army and its men.\\nNo family, no nation can continue to do business the way the Federal Government has been operating and survive.\\nThey see \"community\" as a limited cluster of interest groups, locked in odd conformity.\\nSanctions will take time to have their full intended effect.\\nA hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor.\\nI have many friends to thank tonight.\\nThis year, we\\'ve sent up our new highway bill.\\nLegally, it will provide our disabled community with a powerful expansion of protections and then basic civil rights.\\nFive months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.\\nAnd most of all, it will not let our economy slip out of control.\\nTwice before, those hopes proved to be a distant dream, beyond the grasp of man.\\nNo peaceful international order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors.\"\\nUnite with us, work with us.\\nAnd listen to what they say, for they\\'ve said it better than any President or Prime Minister ever could.\\nAnd there are the homeless.\\nTonight the Democratic and Republican leadership and I all speak with one voice in support of this agreement.\\nIn Helsinki, our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter Iraq\\'s threat to peace.\\nThey remind us who keeps America strong: they do.\\nWe will stand by our friends.\\nI will modernize and preserve our technological edge.\\nWe lifted the yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of, and we ask nothing in return.\\nLast year, we celebrated a victory of international freedom.\\nPretty soon the patient was up, back on his feet, and stronger than ever.\\nWell, when given the opportunity to be independent, they will move proudly into the economic mainstream of American life, and that\\'s what this legislation is all about.\\nI commend, in particular, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and several European nations who have joined us in this purely humanitarian effort.\\nIts passage has made the United States the international leader on this human rights issue.\\nEvery one of our children deserves a first rate school.\\nThis is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki.\\nAnd the parents who settled hungry Kansas would take their children in from the fields when a teacher came.\\nAnd I am not going to let anyone take it away from us.\\nI\\'ll try to hold my charisma in check.\\nAnd thank you very, very much from a grateful people.\\nIt is to allow us to pursue \"the better angels,\" to give us time to think and grow.\\nWe will surely have change this year, but will it be change that moves us forward?\\nThese valiant Americans were ready at a moment\\'s notice to leave their spouses and their children, to serve on the front line halfway around the world.\\nTheir teams play just like others, but—and this is the most remarkable part—as they play, at their sides are volunteer buddies from conventional Little League teams.\\nOur economic life is not the only test of our success, overwhelms all the others, and that is the issue of peace.\\nThe test we face is great, and so are the stakes.\\nWe applaud you and your shining example.\\nAnd we\\'re very happy about that.\\nAnd third, we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in the Middle East.\\nWe saw the excellence embodied in the Patriot missile and the patriots who made it work.\\nFourth, we must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress.\\nThey call for Iraq\\'s immediate and unconditional withdrawal, the restoration of Kuwait\\'s legitimate government, and categorically reject Iraq\\'s cynical and self-serving attempt to annex Kuwait.\\nListen to Hollywood Huddleston, Marine lance corporal.\\nOur ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home.\\nWe hear so often about our young people in turmoil—how our children fall short, how our schools fail us, how American products and American workers are second-class.\\nThere is much that we must do, at home and abroad.\\nBut we\\'re the people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin called slavery - we\\'re the people who rose from the ghettos and the deserts.\\nThere\\'s graft in city hall, the greed on Wall Street; there\\'s influence peddling in Washington, and the small corruptions of everyday ambition.\\nWe must change from abortion - to adoption.\\nThis is never easy in democracies, for we govern only with the consent of the governed.\\nWorked in the oil business, started my own.\\nWell, don\\'t you believe it.\\nBut enduring peace must be our mission.\\nNow, we can see a new world coming into view.\\nIt means teaching troubled children through your presence that there\\'s such a thing as reliable love.\\nAnd if, with the Congress, we can develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month, we can avoid the ax of sequester—deep across-the-board cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption.\\nIt is time for a program that is credible and real.\\nAnd they\\'re right, it is.\\nAnd today, America welcomes into the mainstream of life all of our fellow citizens with disabilities.\\nIf we continue to grow at our current rate, we will be able to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years.\\nEight years ago I stood here with Ronald Reagan and we promised, together, to break with the past and return America to her greatness.\\nYoung Teddy Roosevelt met the new America when he roamed the immigrant streets of New York.\\nAnd finally, to the extent that the deficit reduction program includes new revenue measures, it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward the days of punishing income tax rates.\\nBut Wade also wrote, \"I am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression.\\nThe answer is clear: The world could wait no longer.\\nIn my State of the Union Address and in my budget, I defined a comprehensive agenda to prepare for the next American century.\\nAcross the Nation, some 10,000 youngsters with disabilities are part of Little League\\'s Challenger Division.\\nLet us honor those who have served us by serving others.\\nWe must let these children be our guides and inspiration.\\nOr change that risks retreat?\\nI have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so smooth.\\nI mean to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the issues - and I mean to win.\\nAll of us know the depth of bitterness that has made the dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable.\\nEverywhere I look, I see people who have dedicated themselves to making sure that this day would come to pass: my friends from Congress, as I say, who worked so diligently with the best interest of all at heart, Democrats and Republicans; members of this administration—and I\\'m pleased to see so many top officials and members of my Cabinet here today who brought their caring and expertise to this fight; and then, the organizations—so many dedicated organizations for people with disabilities, who gave their time and their strength; and perhaps most of all, everyone out there and others—across the breadth of this nation are 43 million Americans with disabilities.\\nThey set out to confront an enemy abroad, and in the process, they transformed a nation at home.\\nIt\\'s the toughest deficit reduction package ever, with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed.\\nThey want to work, and they can work, and this is a tremendous pool of people.\\nThese attacks continue as I speak.\\nAmerica and the world must defend common vital interests—and we will.\\nFor seven and a half years I have worked with a President -

there\\'s another threat, a cancer gnawing away at our nation\\'s health.\\n2\\tIt\\'s a little-known fact, but America\\'s best job creators and greatest innovators tend to be our smaller

damage to both, and to our nation as a whole.\\n0\\tThat’s why we’ve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.\\n0\\tWe have the most powerful military on Earth,

our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing?\\n0\\tSo whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it.\\n1\\tAnd we will lead the world in opposing it.\\n1\\tAnd all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.\\n0\\tTonight , I ’ d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq , the ongoing security challenges we face , and the\\n2\\tAnd third, we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in the Middle East.\\n0\\tSo, you see, that\\'s what our democracy demands.\\n0\\tNow, if we want to reverse those trends, there

homeowners, and more investment to produce more jobs.\\n2\\tLet no one doubt our staying power.\\n2\\tOur ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home.\\n0\\tAnd this is a difficult responsibility to embrace , for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes and , yes , religions subjugating one another\\n1\\tWe\\'re also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East.\\n2\\tThey\\'ve already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions.\\n0\\tSome were teenagers when the war began.\\n0\\tAudience members: Four more years!\\n2\\tI accept your nomination for President.\\n2\\tWe\\'re now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders.\\n0\\tThe Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.\\n0\\tIf you doubt you can

complete it?\\n0\\tNow , there is no straight line to realize this promise , but this much is clear : Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable , successful\\n1\\tBut we made it, because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America.\\n0\\tThe men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together\\n0\\tThe wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records.\\n2\\tBut enduring peace must be our

National Guard.\\n1\\tAll nations that decide for aggression and terror will pay a price.\\n0\\tI\\'ll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.\\n0\\tWe have to agree that facts and evidence matter.\\n0\\tI\\'m aware that there\\'s still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11.\\n0\\tAnd to all who serve or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander in Chief.\\n2\\tWe lifted the yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of, and we ask nothing in return.\\n2\\tLast year, we celebrated a victory of international freedom.\\n2\\tAnd so, second, I ask you to take this initiative: Tell your Congressmen and Senators you support this deficit reduction agreement.\\n0\\tThe relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars.\\n0\\tThis new approach reflects our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.\\n0\\tThe obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.\\n1\\tIran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\\n0\\tHe’d get a D.\\n1\\tOur nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists\\' movements, freeze their finances, and break up their plots.\\n2\\tAnd so I know that what it all comes down to , this election - what it all comes down to , after all the shouting and the cheers\\n0\\tOn November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight

our people remains another terrorist attack.\\n1\\tFor much of the last century, America\\'s defense relied on the Cold War doctrines of deterrence and containment.\\n0\\tOf course, the soldiers left much behind.\\n1\\tAnd though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.\\n2\\tSo, our budget plan will give small and medium-size companies a needed shot in the arm.\\n1\\tThe peoples of the Islamic nations want and deserve the same freedoms and opportunities as people in every nation.\\n1\\tOur security will require transforming the military you will lead -- a military that must be

been\\n1\\tAll Americans are in this together.\\n2\\tThat support will be even more important in the days to come.\\n0\\tAnd it is that promise that forty five years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington ,\\n2\\tBut America, don\\'t let \\'em fool ya.\\n0\\tThis is not simply about America\\'s interests.\\n0\\tI believe that\\'s misguided.\\n1\\tBut we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism.\\n0\\tThe second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians, and the Arab world.\\n2\\tThe agreement is fair, and so is the American spirit.\\n0\\tWe can invest in early childhood education.\\n0\\t“My peers give me a lot of hope that we’ll overcome the obstacles we face in society.”  That\\'s you!\\n0\\tOf course, violence will not end with our combat mission.\\n0\\tLast February , I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq , while

front.\\n0\\tMalia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women.\\n0\\tThe Holy Bible tells us: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\"\\n1\\tAnd you walk in the tradition of second lieutenants who did the same, by fighting and dying on distant battlefields.\\n0\\t(Laughter and applause.)\\n1\\tWe will expand intelligence-sharing and deploy Patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies.\\n0\\tWhen Washington doesn\\'t work, all its promises seem empty.\\n0\\tThe point is , to help

thank the American people for the trust you have given me.\\n2\\tFirst, we must work together to create shared security arrangements in the region.\\n2\\tIndeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety.\\n1\\tAnd we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.\\n2\\tBut now it\\'s time to produce.\\n1\\tMr. Secretary , Governor Pataki , members of the United States Congress , Academy staff and faculty , distinguished guests , proud family members , and graduates : I\\n0\\tFor while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11 , I stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us\\n0\\tAnd such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic.\\n0\\tFor part of what has been lost these past eight years can\\'t just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.\\n0\\tBut privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away.\\n2\\tAnd fourth , the Congress should , this month , enact a 5-year program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by $ 500 billion—that \\'s by half a\\n0\\tBut what the people heard instead—people of

battlefield medicine.\\n2\\tAs I report to you, air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq.\\n2\\tThey call it a Swiss cheese economy.\\n0\\tThat\\'s it, Class of 2016 -- (laughter) -- a few suggestions on how you can change the world.\\n2\\tAs for me, I have held high office and done the work of democracy day by day.\\n1\\tI ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.\\n1\\tAnd in the long run, advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens.\\n0\\tThe United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\\n1\\tOur democratic faith is more than the creed of our country , it is the inborn hope of our humanity , an ideal we carry but do not own\\n0\\tWords alone cannot meet the needs of our people.\\n0\\tWe ’ ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could\\n1\\tIn a tradition dating back to our founding, the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you, the American people.\\n2\\tThey emerged from their bunker broken, tears streaming from their eyes, fearing the worst.\\n0\\tBut there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend.\\n1\\tWhen people have hope in the future, they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism.\\n0\\tAnd that\\'s why I strongly reaffirmed America\\'s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.\\n2\\tMoslems and non-Moslems, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein\\'s ambitions.\\n2\\tHe will go to listen, to probe, to offer suggestions—to advance the search for peace and stability.\\n0\\tResistance through violence and killing is wrong, and it does not succeed.\\n0\\tAmerica , we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character are n\\'t even willing to enter into public\\n0\\tIt\\'s not because I wasn’t proposing them.\\n1\\tToday, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation\\'s promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.\\n1\\tAmerica has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil.\\n1\\tBut there can be little debate about the results.\\n2\\tFor the sake of our principles, for the sake of the Kuwaiti people, we stood our ground.\\n1\\tWe must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.\\n1\\tThe bill also ensures that these new programs are carried out in a way that protects taxpayers.\\n2\\tAnd finally , we should all sit up and listen to Jackie Jones , an Army lieutenant , when she says , `` If we let him get away\\n2\\tWe\\'re glad you\\'re here.\\n1\\tThey remind us that we all begin our lives as a small collection of cells.\\n0\\tThere’s more

commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait.\\n0\\tBut I also know that human progress cannot be denied.\\n0\\tDon\\'t feel like you got to shut your ears off because you\\'re too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities.\\n2\\tI\\'ve been to the factories that feel the strain of change.\\n0\\tU.S. troops pulled out of Iraq’s cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.\\n0\\tAnd this trend represents a third threat to our democracy.\\n1\\tGod bless you all, and

shared.\\n2\\tI may sometimes be a little awkward, but there\\'s nothing self-conscious in my love of country.\\n2\\tWhile the world waited, Saddam sought to add to the chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses, an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction—a nuclear weapon.\\n0\\tThis, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.\\n1\\tWhen this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.\\n0\\tIt depends on us , on the choices we make , particularly at certain inflection points in history ; particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up\\n2\\tI will increase the power of parents.\\n1\\tI recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region.\\n1\\tI

that a new century is spared new horrors.\\n0\\tAnd although Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be , our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant\\n0\\tAnd every day, I have learned from you.\\n1\\tMoral truth is the same in every culture, in every time, and in every place.\\n0\\tWe know that is God\\'s vision, now that must be our work here on Earth.\\n2\\tIraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions , and then , when peace is restored , it is our hope that Iraq will live as

drawn from children , adults , and the blood in umbilical cords , with no\\n0\\tAs we do, I’m mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.\\n0\\tThroughout our history , a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom , and more opportunity ,\\n1\\tAnd with strong allies at our side, we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them.\\n0\\tThey have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.\\n0\\tAt this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to

loyalty all these years.\\n2\\tOne way or another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth.\\n1\\tOver the past seven years, a new Department of Homeland Security has been created.\\n0\\tAs a student of history, I also know civilization\\'s debt to Islam.\\n2\\tOur quarrel is with Iraq\\'s dictator and with his aggression.\\n0\\tThese are qualities you want to continue

who don’t agree with you.\\n0\\tThe greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.\\n0\\tThat is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require.\\n1\\tI made it clear to the Congress that I will not allow our nation to cross this moral line.\\n2\\tI\\'m hopeful, in fact, I\\'m confident that the Congress will do what it should.\\n0\\tTonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land—enough!\\n2\\tTo revitalize our leadership, our leadership capacity, we must address our budget deficit—not after election day, or next year, but now.\\n1\\tI will live and lead by these principles : to advance my convictions with civility , to pursue the public interest with courage , to speak for greater justice\\n0\\tOne of the perks of my job is honorary degrees.\\n2\\tThey promise - we perform.\\n0\\tAnd I will not settle for an America where some kids don\\'t have that chance.\\n1\\tYet the war on terror will not be won on the defensive.\\n1\\tAnd even in the toughest times, we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead.\\n0\\tIt\\'s been about you.\\n0\\tAmerica respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them.\\n0\\tMoreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one\\'s religion.\\n2\\tThe spirit of Democracy is sweeping the Pacific rim.\\n1\\tTogether, we will reclaim America\\'s schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.\\n1\\tA civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.\\n0\\tThat\\'s the change we need right now.\\n1\\tI\\'ve made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq\\'s other leaders that America\\'s commitment is not open-ended.\\n0\\tEither way, you win.\\n2\\tI\\'m sure that many of you saw on the television the unforgettable scene of four terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering.\\n1\\tWe\\'ve got large challenges here in America.\\n2\\tMembers of Congress, 5 short weeks ago I came to this House to speak to you about the state of the Union.\\n1\\tThis evening, my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house—September the 11th, 2001.\\n0\\tAmerica, this is one of those moments.\\n0\\tOf all that I\\'ve done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.\\n1\\tA school will be given time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that people can succeed.\\n0\\tBecause in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.\\n2\\tOur role is to help our friends in their own self-defense.\\n0\\tBut I have to tell you, it impresses nobody in my house.\\n0\\tBut we must never lose sight of what’s at stake.\\n2\\tAfter all, the facts are on our side.\\n2\\tIran and Iraq move toward peace.\\n2\\tWhen you get a bill, that bill must be paid.\\n0\\tThat’s how democracy works.\\n0\\tIt actually happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing, and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion.\\n2\\tFive months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.\\n1\\tThese teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance.\\n0\\tAnd, Class of 2016, it is your turn now -- (applause) -- to shape our nation’s destiny, as well as your own.\\n1\\tOn the other side are extremists who kill the innocent, and have declared their intention to destroy our way of life.\\n2\\tI wish I could say that their work is done.\\n0\\tBut if our democracy is to work , the way it should , in this increasingly diverse Nation , then each one of us need to try to heed\\n2\\tI have come to this hall to tell you, and to tell America: Tonight is the night.\\n1\\tWe\\'ve got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction.\\n1\\tSo America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.\\n2\\tOur operations are designed to best protect the lives of all the coalition forces by targeting Saddam\\'s vast military arsenal.\\n0\\tThat\\'s the economic argument.\\n1\\tWe thought that these elections would bring the Iraqis together, and that as we trained Iraqi security forces we could accomplish our mission with fewer American troops.\\n0\\tThousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad, the last of them passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours.\\n0\\tAnd no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda.\\n0\\tThat\\'s a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.\\n0\\tWhy else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?\\n1\\tMuch time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.\\n2\\tThe ones who raise the family, pay the taxes, meet the mortgage.\\n0\\tDon\\'t tell me that Democrats won\\'t keep us safe.\\n2\\tOur success with this act proves that we are keeping faith with the spirit of our courageous forefathers who wrote in the Declaration of Independence : `` We hold\\n1\\tHomeland defense and missile defense are part of stronger security, and they\\'re essential priorities for America.\\n2\\tEveryone who can should contribute something, and no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share.\\n0\\tThe Holy Koran tells us: \"O mankind!\\n2\\tAnd surely, that is now clear.\\n1\\tHe was dogged in his determination to get this bill done.\\n0\\tThey\\'ll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.\\n2\\tPretty soon the patient was up, back on his feet, and stronger than ever.\\n1\\tAnd though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.\\n0\\tMore recently , tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims and a cold war in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated\\n0\\tIt is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children or to blow up old women on a bus.\\n2\\tGenerous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations, such as Turkey and Egypt.\\n1\\tAnd as the sun set on their struggle, many of those West Point officers lived to see a world transformed.\\n0\\tOur unity at home was tested.\\n1\\tYou know this , but many in America do n\\'t -- George C. Marshall , a VMI graduate , is said to have given this order : `` I\\n1\\tOther nations oppose terror, but tolerate the hatred that leads to terror -- and that must change.\\n2\\tThe consequences of regional instability can be global.\\n0\\tIsolating or disparaging Muslims , suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country -- ( applause ) -- that is not just a\\n0\\tAnd so at this moment , as we wind down the war in Iraq , we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy , and grit\\n0\\tAs we speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\n2\\tLet us honor them with our gratitude.\\n0\\tAs a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation’s long-term competitiveness is put at risk.\\n0\\tYou took on a role you didn\\'t ask for and you made it your own, with grace and with grit and with style and good humor.\\n1\\tMy policy has allowed us to explore the potential of embryonic stem cells, and it has allowed America to continue to lead the world in this area.\\n0\\tFinally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.\\n0\\tHere, too, it’s time to turn the page.\\n0\\tLook at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan , who began organizing anti-bullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination , and here at\\n0\\tIf your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it\\'s best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.\\n1\\tIn this way our struggle is similar to the Cold War.\\n2\\tThe Congress will push me to raise taxes , and I \\'ll say no , and they \\'ll push , and I \\'ll say no , and they \\'ll\\n0\\tI know there\\'s been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust.\\n1\\tIn Washington, there\\'s some smart people there, but the people who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton.\\n2\\tAnd then, specifically, first the ADA ensures that employers covered by the act cannot discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities.\\n1\\tThe consequences of failure are clear: Radical Islamic extremists would grow in strength and gain new recruits.\\n2\\tAnd this I promise you : For all that Saddam has done to his own people , to the Kuwaitis , and to the entire world , Saddam and\\n1\\tMurdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere.\\n0\\tAnd that\\'s to be expected.\\n0\\tLook, as President, my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States.\\n2\\tSome would say it\\'s soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things.\\n2\\tMy opponent says no - but I say yes.\\n1\\tAs the Commander-in-Chief, I hereby grant amnesty to all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses.\\n0\\t(The wind starts blowing hard.)\\n0\\tBut that potential will only be realized if our democracy works.\\n2\\tThat scene says a lot about America, a lot about who we are.\\n1\\tSpeaking here to the class of 1942 -- six months after Pearl Harbor -- General Marshall said , `` We \\'re determined that before the sun sets on this\\n2\\tI am guided by certain traditions.\\n0\\tMore women are in the workforce.\\n2\\tFor example, in 1990, we enacted an historic Clean Air Act.\\n0\\tWe traditionally have valued those things.\\n0\\tAnd that\\'s why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started.\\n2\\tWe will surely have change this year, but will it be change that moves us forward?\\n1\\tAnd I look forward to working with Congress and the scientific community to achieve these great and noble goals in the years ahead.\\n2\\tAn Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power , as well as the arrogance , to intimidate and coerce its neighbors—neighbors who control the\\n0\\tAnd a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed -- that \\'s one of the changes that \\'s been taking place -- jobs shipped\\n2\\tThis does not mean stationing U.S. ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula, but it does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces.\\n1\\tBut the themes of this day he would know: our nation\\'s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\\n2\\tProsperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it concrete by certain acts of goodness.\\n0\\tThere\\'s so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.\\n1\\tThis will require increasing American force levels.\\n2\\tOur Secretary of State, James Baker, held an historic meeting in Geneva, only to be totally rebuffed.\\n2\\tUntil now, the world we\\'ve known has been a world divided—a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict, and cold war.\\n0\\tI know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq.\\n0\\tSome suggest that it isn\\'t worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash.\\n2\\tThis victory belongs to the finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history.\\n1\\tWe\\'ve got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works.\\n1\\tIt is a gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children.\\n2\\tThere can be no substitute for diplomacy.\\n0\\tI also know that Islam has always been a part of America\\'s story.\\n0\\tThey have fought in our wars ; they have served in our government ; they have stood for civil rights ; they have started businesses ; they have taught\\n0\\tWhat the nay-sayers don\\'t understand is that this election has never been about me.\\n0\\tSo you have made me proud.\\n0\\tThis country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime\\n0\\tNow, I don\\'t think it\\'s a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration.\\n0\\tI realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.\\n2\\tTonight, as our troops begin to come home, let us recognize that the hard work of freedom still calls us forward.\\n0\\tBut, as was the case in Iraq, we can’t do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.\\n2\\tAnd when his defeated legions come home, all Iraqis will see and feel the havoc he has wrought.\\n0\\tI only have two more points.\\n0\\tBut I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.\\n2\\tThe ADA is a dramatic renewal not only for those with disabilities but for all of us , because along with the precious privilege of being an American comes\\n2\\tIt means teaching troubled children through your presence that there\\'s such a thing as reliable love.\\n0\\tAmerica, now is not the time for small plans.\\n0\\tWe see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during

experienced setbacks.\\n1\\tI want to thank Tracy Miller for being so hospitable.\\n0\\tBut the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.\\n1\\tAnd as a result, our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists.\\n1\\tThis is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger, and compassion

providing more than $2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on.\\n1\\tIn the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our
